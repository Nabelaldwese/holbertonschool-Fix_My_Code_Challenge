# Fix My Code Challenge - FizzBuzz

This folder contains the fix for task `0-fizzbuzz.py`.

## Issue fixed

- The implementation printed `Fizz` for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (like 15).
- Correct behavior is to print `FizzBuzz`.

## Fix applied

- Check divisibility by 15 first, then by 3, then by 5.

## Task 1 - Print square

- Added `1-print_square.js`.
- The script now prints a square using `#` with exactly `size` rows and `size` columns.

## Task 2 - Sort

- Added `2-sort.rb`.
- The script now filters numeric arguments, sorts them in ascending order, and prints one value per line.

## Task 3 - User password

- Added `3-user.py`.
- Fixed password handling by hashing on set and validating against the same hash method.

## Task 4 - Double linked list

- Added `4-delete_dnodeint/` C files for the doubly linked list exercise.
- Fixed node deletion logic at index by correctly relinking `prev` and `next`, updating head when needed, and handling invalid indexes safely.
